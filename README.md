Byte Racers is a fast-paced, horizontally scrolling car racing game built entirely in C for the MSPM0 microcontroller platform and displayed on a 128x160 ST7735 TFT LCD screen. Designed as an embedded systems project, the game showcases real-time control and hardware-level programming by integrating analog input from a slide potentiometer for steering, digital push-button input for gear shifting, and sound output through a piezo speaker. Players navigate a car to avoid oncoming enemy vehicles, with gameplay intensifying as the speed increases through gear changes. A timer driven by SysTick and TimerG12 interrupts tracks how long the player survives, which serves as their score. The game features smooth bitmap rendering with transparent backgrounds, efficient partial screen redraws to minimize flicker, and collision detection based on sprite boundaries. Upon collision, a crash animation plays, a sound effect is triggered, and a game-over screen displays the final time survived. Byte Racers also includes a bilingual start screen where users can select between English and Español, providing a more inclusive experience. All visual and input elements are handled using direct register access and interrupt-driven design, with no operating system or external libraries involved. Beyond entertainment, the project serves as a hands-on application of low-level embedded skills, including peripheral configuration (ADC, GPIO, SPI, timers), fixed-point math, real-time event handling, and modular software architecture. Whether you're a student learning embedded systems, a developer exploring microcontroller graphics, or just someone looking to play a mini arcade-style game built on hardware from scratch, Byte Racers is a complete and polished example of what’s possible with clever programming and constrained resources.
